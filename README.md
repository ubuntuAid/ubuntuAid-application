# Why Now?  
In a region confronted by over 6.3 million refugees (UNHCR report 2019) with Uganda as the highest refugee host in Africa due to the levels of conflicts and displacements, and with the need for humanitarian aid exceeding available funding, a new way of working with refugees/displaced persons and their migrant communities is a necessity if we are to prepare them for a life beyond ‚Äúfrom hand to mouth syndrome‚Äù which about 95% of humanitarian aid is all about.
